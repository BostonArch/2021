Bringing together computer architecture community in the Greater Boston area and beyond.


Each year BARC is composed of numerous informal 15-30 minute presentations, long discussion breaks sessions, and talks by notable community members doing exciting things in computer architecture. As always, elegant as well as preliminary solutions to architectural problems are welcome. This year we have excellent talks lined up, and we hope you’ll enjoy them and learn something new in the process. Please reach out to the presenters with questions, collaboration ideas, insights, or comments. The goal of BARC is to provide a forum for computer architects in the Greater Boston area and beyond to get together and present/discuss the ’latest and greatest’ in the area of computer architecture. Each year, community members discuss current ideas and concepts in Microarchitecture, Multicore/manycore processors, GPUs, Memory systems, I/O, Networkingand communication, Low power systems, Adaptive and hybrid systems, Architectures basedon emerging technologies, Accelerator-based architectures, Embedded processing, Performance evaluation techniques, Hardware Description Languages, Hardware security, and much more!
